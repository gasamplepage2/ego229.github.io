        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello, My name is Eric as you can see from the pretty big header at the top of this page. There are a lot of layers to who i am but for the sake of sanity and brevity ill keep it short. I am 43 years old, married with a sophomore daughter in college. I am from a VERY small town if you blik while traveling through you will miss the whole town. With that being said, it is huge on hospitality and fellowship. Everybody knows everybody and no one is a stranger. My upbringing has a lot to do with who i have become as a person. Having dealt with almost every culture on the planet, my values i learned in my village travels well with me and has allowed people to trust me and let me into their world and personal space because of my small town, honest driven disposition. Other than my wife and daughter the thing that gets me out of bed and moving forward is the accomplishing of goals that i set for myself.</p>

    <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
      
      <p>I recently graduated with my Master of Science in Information Systems which was a tall task given that I am a devoted father and husband and at the time I was working a full time job. I had a lot of support from my family who gave me the motivation and the time and space to finish what I set out to do. I feel that we all earned the degree together. </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
        
        <p>I have so many goals in mind but for the time being I am focused on finishing the course I am currently enrolled in at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive">General Assembly</a> seeking a certificate of completion in Software Engineering Immersive course. I know the work will be hard but what else is new in my challenging life.</p>
